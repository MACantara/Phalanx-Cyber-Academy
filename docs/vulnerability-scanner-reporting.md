### Nmap Integration Workflow

1. **Run Nmap Scan in Terminal**
   ```bash
   # Basic scan
   nmap vote.municipality.gov
   
   # Vulnerability scan
   nmap --script=vuln vote.municipality.gov
   
   # Comprehensive scan
   nmap -A -sV --script=vuln vote.municipality.gov
   ```

2. **Integrate Results**
   - **Automatic**: After nmap scan completes, use `nmap --integrate`
   - **Manual**: Click "Nmap Data" button in vulnerability scanner and paste results
   - **From Terminal**: Run `nmap --integrate` after any scan

3. **Generate Enhanced Reports**
   - Reports will now include network scan data
   - Port information, service versions, and network-level vulnerabilities
   - Comprehensive attack surface analysis

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+R**: Generate HTML report

## Best Practices

### Scan Strategy
1. **Start with Network Discovery**
   ```bash
   nmap -sn 192.168.100.0/24  # Host discovery
   nmap -sV -O target.com     # Service/OS detection
   nmap --script=vuln target.com  # Vulnerability scripts
   ```

2. **Follow with Application Scanning**
   - Use vulnerability scanner on identified web services
   - Focus on application-specific vulnerabilities
   - Test for business logic flaws

3. **Integrate and Report**
   - Combine network and application scan results
   - Generate comprehensive reports
   - Provide actionable remediation guidance

### Report Customization
- **Target Audience**: Adjust technical detail level for audience
- **Compliance Requirements**: Include specific framework mappings
- **Risk Tolerance**: Customize severity thresholds and scoring
- **Timeline Considerations**: Adjust remediation timelines based on resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Integration Fails**
   - Ensure Vulnerability Scanner app is open
   - Check that nmap scan completed successfully
   - Verify nmap output contains expected data

2. **Report Generation Errors**
   - Confirm scan has completed successfully
   - Check that vulnerabilities were discovered
   - Ensure browser allows file downloads

3. **Missing Data in Reports**
   - Verify scan completed without errors
   - Check that all desired scan options were enabled
   - Ensure nmap integration was successful if using combined data

### Support
