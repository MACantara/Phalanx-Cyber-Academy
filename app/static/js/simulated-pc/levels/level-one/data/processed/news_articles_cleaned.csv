Reasoning With Facts,2016-10-29T08:47:11.259+03:00,100percentfedup.com,Real,Attorney General Loretta Lynch pleads the fifth.,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch plead the fifth. The administration is blocking a congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course, she needs to plead the fifth - she can't recall, refuses to answer, or plain deflects every question. It's straight corruption at its finest. They're talking about covering their ass. Loretta Lynch plead the fifth to avoid incriminating herself regarding payments to Iran. Corrupt to the core. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress into the Obama administration's secret efforts to send Iran billions in cash, prompting accusations that Lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself. The payments to lawmakers and communications obtained by the Washington beacon show that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) initially presented Lynch with a series of questions about the cash payment to Iran that was approved and delivered in October. In response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch's behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any information about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney general's office is unacceptable and provides evidence that Lynch has essentially plead the fifth to refuse to respond to inquiries about her role in providing cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, according to Rubio and Pompeo in a follow-up letter to Lynch."

Trump's 7-point plan to reform healthcare begins with a bombshell.,"Healthcare reform will make America great again, since all Americans suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This legislation was passed through partisan votes in both the House and Senate, and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in American history. It has tragically and predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition, and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised economic uncertainty for every single person residing in this country, and it appears that Obamacare will collapse under the weight of its own damage. Done by the Democrats, President Obama, and aided by the Supreme Court, this repair work - unless a new president and Republican Congress make an effort - will require much-needed market reforms to the healthcare industry. Congress must act as the elected representatives in both the House and Senate to repeal Obamacare. The elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless they want to. They should modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state, allowing true competition into the insurance market, which will bring down insurance costs and consumer satisfaction. They should allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions, so why wouldn't Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? They should allow individuals to use health savings accounts (HSAs), enabling market insurance coverage opportunities for companies and individuals who also slip through the cracks and simply cannot afford insurance. They should require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations that receive tax dollars from the government, enabling basic Medicaid to ensure that no person requiring healthcare coverage is left behind."

Prince claimed that the State Department emails were damning - criminal money laundering. The fact that Hillary went to that sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein - Bill Clinton went there 20 times, Hillary Clinton went at least 6 times. These aren't just garbage emails about criminal activity by Hillary and her immediate circle. Democratic members of Congress find it disgusting that the FBI isn't going public. If they don't reopen this investigation, they don't do anything, and there won't be timely indictments, Prince explained. He believes he is well-placed to make these claims."

The case should 'drain the swamp.' FBI Director James Comey announced that the agency has reviewed Hillary Clinton's emails discovered in an unrelated case and concluded not to prosecute Clinton. The FBI's original investigation into her private server stands, Comey informed Congress in October. The agency found in an unrelated case additional emails from Clinton's time running the State Department. Since Comey's letter, FBI investigative teams have been working around the clock to process this volume of emails. Comey sent a follow-up letter to Congress saying the communications from Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State have not changed the conclusion of the case. The emails were purportedly from ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, using a laptop he shared with his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, for sexting with an apparently underage female."

The president wants to ensure that students know the university remains committed to its responsibility as a school, apparently committed to education, discovery, intellectual honesty, diversity, equity, and inclusion for all members of the university community. The election coverage was an opportunity to visit with students and staff about the results, watching the event at Ginsberg Center in Michigan Union to absorb the results of yesterday's election and its implications, and to discern the long-term impact on the university and the nation. In the immediate aftermath of this close and highly contentious election, we must embrace our responsibility as a university community - a responsibility rooted in our commitment to education, discovery, intellectual honesty, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Together, we must engage respectfully across ideological differences with those who feel marginalized, threatened, or unwelcome as we pursue knowledge and understanding. As always, our students, faculty, and staff are at the heart of the University of Michigan. Reports indicate that members of the community are offering students planning a vigil tonight on the Diag. The Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources for faculty seeking to cultivate classroom environments responsive to national issues. Also, everyone should be aware of plans for events at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy holding a post-election discussion in Weill Hall's Annenberg Auditorium with speakers including former Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson, and Marina Whitman.

Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a post-election dialogue about impact, perspective-taking, and moving forward. This event is part of Student Life Professional Development Conference at Michigan League's Henderson Room. Schools, colleges, and offices across campus are planning similar events as well. Thank you to everyone for helping us come together. Anyone scheduling an election-related event should add it to the University of Michigan events calendar. We proudly embrace the opportunities for our students, faculty, and staff at this great public research university. Governed by elections, we often see times of great change. Our values have been shaped over the course of many years, and our mission remains as essential to society as ever. We serve Michigan and the world through our preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving, and applying knowledge and art, and our academic values include developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. We look forward to working together to advance this mission in service to the public good, ensuring that the University of Michigan is always welcoming to all members of our society.

Tuesday's vote shows 98% of precincts reporting that Hillary Clinton got 6 million fewer votes than Barack Obama did in 2012. The conclusion is that Clinton failed to reach the White House because she failed to energize the Democratic base. The truth is that she underperformed relative to Obama's totals in key Midwestern states: Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Clinton virtually matched Obama in battleground states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What's more, she actually surpassed Obama's vote total in Florida, the country's biggest swing state. In 2012, Obama won Florida with 4.2 million votes; Clinton brings that question.

Here's how McNaughton describes the painting: Against the background of a darkening sky, the presidents of the United States gather at the White House to commemorate a great event. In the hand corner of the painting sits Obama with his head bowed, appearing distraught and hopeless as he contemplates the future. The other presidents console him, looking in his direction. Modern presidents seem to have done well, while modern presidents are seemingly oblivious to anything, congratulating themselves on their great accomplishments. Paper and trash are blowing in the wind - crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, whispers of the Constitution beneath Obama's foot. Barack Obama has forgotten them.

She's sick and unfit to serve even one term, but I supported her anyhow because she's a Democrat with a vagina and had a chance of winning the presidency. I signed a petition saying Trump didn't win, but Hillary should get the vote. Okay, let's address this. Hillary should get the vote, but it isn't an Electoral College situation. This isn't an awful thing. In fact, it's an awful thing to think about - the great Electoral College protects the importance of every vote and is also uniquely American. It demonstrates, once again, the brilliance of our founding fathers. She's going to get more actual votes cast than Trump. Here's why: votes are counted, but the votes cast in certain states don't count absentee ballots unless the outstanding absentee ballots are larger than the state's margin of difference. If the margin of votes counted exceeds the absentee ballots outstanding, the state doesn't tabulate the outstanding absentee ballots because they wouldn't influence the election results. So millions of absentee ballots aren't counted every election cycle. Who votes by absentee ballot? Students, overseas military, businesspeople on trips, etc. Historically, the breakout of absentee ballots has been heavily Republican. In 2000, Gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes. Liberals screamed bloody murder. Yet there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone whose breakout yields a 2-to-1 Republican vote advantage. Had Bush gotten a 2-to-1 vote margin from California's uncounted absentee ballots alone, Bush would have won Gore's popular vote victory. Headline that in the New York Times or on NBC Nightly News! You're kidding. You're getting upset about the popular vote/lose electoral college scenario instead of thanking God that someone else in California can't determine every election. The Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in voting proclivities among states and regions - farmers in farm country, importers and exporters on the shore, all are equal to Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. Without it, the shortcomings of the popular vote would make it meaningless in heavily populated states, and vice versa. The Electoral College ensures the country's entire population isn't subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of populous states. American Thinker."

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,21stcenturywire.com,Fake,DNC party corruption: Clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced DNC consultant.,"21st Century Wire: Patrick Henningsen of 21st Century Wire says that as the soap opera drags on, it's becoming evident that the Russian government didn't hack the DNC. Moscow isn't feeding John Podesta's emails to WikiLeaks, despite being deeply invested in the official conspiracy theory. It's a hard pill to swallow for the White House and Hillary Clinton campaign, who are married to the idea that Putin is hacking elections. In response, the president is weighing tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status for Russian envoys, and deploying newly developed malicious cyber-activity tools. Joe Biden wants to take action, threatening Moscow by saying, 'We're sending a message' about their capacity. It seems that ever since Washington started issuing threats to Russia, US-Russian relations have been trending downward. The defense industry and power struggles have infected America's left-wing with a formerly right-wing neoconservative hawks for war stance - holdouts that have infected America's left-wing as a firm plank of the Democratic Party platform, evidenced by Hillary Clinton's constant anti-Russian rhetoric this election cycle. The White House and Clinton have transformed Democrats into the vanguard of Washington's anti-Russia movement. Josh Rogin of the Washington Post reports that the Clinton campaign plans to escalate rhetoric against Russia if Trump wins. Trump has suggested Russia hacked Clinton's private server to release emails, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic surrogates bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone paying attention knows the Russian hack talking point is purely political. Who's paying attention these days? You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party's hardcore anti-Russian strategy to President Vladimir Putin's mild, passing remark about Donald Trump's GOP primary success - at which point Trump's political opponents targeted his words, comparing him to a dictator. They never pass up an opportunity to score political points. President Obama has acted on intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of a 'bromance.' 'You've had a career idealizing Ronald Reagan, but your party's nominee for president is kissing up to Vladimir Putin,' Obama said in October at a Clinton rally in Miami. Backed by Obama, the White House and Clinton are pressing ahead, blaming Russia for controversial DNC leaks and also for hacking election systems in Arizona - a charge devoid of evidence, full of innuendo and speculation. The media's coverage of this issue has been deceptive from the onset. A leading example is the release entitled 'Russian Hackers Targeted Arizona Election System.' The cocksure headline in the first paragraph always sounds definitive: 'Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona,' the FBI alerted Arizona. 'Russians were behind the assault on the election system,' the state said. But it advanced quickly into retreat and a zone of uncertainty. The bureau described the threat as credible, but the scale was unclear. Matt Roberts, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan's result, said Reagan shut down the state's voter registration system, but nothing indicates hackers compromised any state system, county system, or stole any username, password, or single election official information from Gila County. At no point was there evidence - ever - just ambiguous statements from cyber security officials who agree it looks like Russian government-directed hack. American politicians are callous enough to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to serve short-term political ambitions. American political life has arrived at a cul-de-sac - translated from French as 'dead end' - where politicians in power are so insecure they makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories during a national election cycle. It's a depressing prospect, seeing a presidential election behind Clinton's wild, hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and WikiLeaks. The White House and Obama administration have formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and high-profile individuals like Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, then giving them to WikiLeaks. Queue the national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) on the Homeland Security Committee spouted that Russia will face consequences if Moscow orchestrated the hacks. 'Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it unless the United States can upend Putin's calculus with a diplomatic, political, cyber, and economic response,' Washington Post technology editor Ellen Nakashima reports. The evidence seems to rest on corporate alleged Russian government hacks by the cyber security company CrowdStrike, but actual specifics are never meant to be revealed - we're just supposed to take private firm CrowdStrike's word for it."
Shawn Helton,2016-11-04T00:03:00.000+02:00,21stcenturywire.com,Fake,Partners in crime: Goldman Sachs and the Clintons on Wall Street.,"21st Century Wire reports that the biggest revelation from WikiLeaks' epic trove of emails was covered by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger. WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes the whole collection reveals. WikiLeaks reveals outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urging John Podesta, advisor to President Barack Obama, to pressure Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar for providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL (Islamic State/ISIS) and other radical Sunni groups. This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation was knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from Gulf states while Secretary Clinton and President Obama were aware they were funding ISIS, Nusra, Al-Qaeda Syria, and other Takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. In addition to Clinton's foundation money from Gulf monarchies, this infographic from Conservative Review validates what 21st Century Wire has been saying since the ISIS crisis began, according to Fox News and FBI sources."

Any doubts can finally be put to rest - it seems Europe's technocrats have surrendered to their program of Euro red scare brainwashing. The resolution compares Russian organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS and also claims Russian trolls are challenging Democratic values. Anti-Russia legislation worth millions in funding will implement anti-Russia programs because bureaucrats believe they must counter this grave threat to democracy. The touch of oxymoronic irony isn't lost - parliamentarians are plotting, claiming Europe is at war with Russia. The whole thing is a hysterical notion that Russian propaganda is damaging the minds of Europeans on a whole new level of crazy. I wonder why millions of Britons voted to leave this summer? The reality is that views aired by presenters, contributors, and pundits - both Westerners and Russians - are the reason RT's audience ratings are growing. What's being presented is resonating with international audiences because RT's reports are more accurate and truthful than the monoliths like BBC, CNN, and other establishment outlets spending all their effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover up a plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally. Western media is killing its relationship with domestic audiences in an age of people talking to the public, assuming they're fools. The network has been shaped for years, with Western moguls playing catch-up, albeit in vain. It's sunset for Goebbels, hamstrung by layers of management committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of the state. This star chamber is a tangled web of subterfuge obsessed with controlling and disseminating information in an environment so dysfunctional it's simply unable to provide authentic journalism or truth to power. It's incredibly ironic that while working for Western propaganda, this phase of the regime ideologues in Brussels attacks the faceless force behind the latest xenophobic resolution. Washington, Paris, and London are hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions as a disservice to European businesses and workers losing trade with Russia. Once Donald Trump is sworn in, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis will disintegrate. This latest Brussels effort is a last-ditch attempt to damage Europe's neo-McCarthyites and plot an escape door from the disastrous coup d'état in Ukraine, NATO's hubris in the Baltics, and the EU's migrant crisis debacle. Tens of millions of euros have been laundered through US pseudo-NGO White Helmets in Syria. These are just a few chapters in modern diplomatic history of abject failure and incompetent foreign policy underpinned by backward, confused ideology. There's no coherent Western reporting on this subject - it seems Western mainstream media is too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. Following an international vote, MEPs in Strasbourg voted on a non-legislative resolution that calls to respond to information warfare from Russia. Sputnik agency is alleged to be among the tools of hostile propaganda. Parliament's resolution demonstrates political degradation with regard to the idea of democracy in the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin, commenting on the vote, pointed out that everyone tries to lecture Russia about democracy, yet European lawmakers resort to restrictions on issues they can't approach for discussion with solid arguments - the only ones they can present. Putin added that he hopes Western efforts to counter Russian propaganda won't involve restrictions. The president congratulated Sputnik journalists on the vote. MEPs who supported the resolution on strategic communication to counteract propaganda by third parties were voting, with some abstaining. Polish European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) member Anna Fotyga alleged that Moscow aims to distort truth, provoke doubt, divide North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit institutions, and incite fear and uncertainty among citizens. She suggests Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU states, causing disintegration of the bloc. Russia is accused of information warfare. Entities like RT channel, Sputnik agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency, and Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund are alleged to be among the threatening propaganda tools. The document places Russian organizations alongside terrorist groups like Islamic State (formerly ISIS/ISIL) and also mentions trolls from Russia who challenge Democratic values. The EU establishment measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat means investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media. It also suggests stronger cooperation with NATO strategic communication. Sputnik appealed to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), international journalists' organizations, NGOs, and Reporters Without Borders about measures it considers interference with freedom of speech. The resolution hits straight at the respected Sputnik agency with the aim of stopping its activity. The resolution bluntly contradicts the EU's human rights and freedom of the press norms, reads a letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. The parliamentary debate that preceded the vote saw MEPs campaigning for the resolution to wage information war against Russia, putting the EU on a collision course traveling faster than a jet fighter. The alleged aim is to split Europe from the Kremlin's sphere of influence between countries."

Sixteen states are using balloting equipment from a company tied to leftist billionaire Edmund Kozak. October concerns are growing over revelations that voting machines in several states are linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest for a nationless, borderless global state.

Smartmatic chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN official who sits on the board of Soros' Open Society Foundations. Since the flowchart disappeared, Smartmatic is raising questions about the status of Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it's deployed in elections. Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough - he also has ties to the Clintons through consulting firms and the National Association of Secretaries of State.

Feds identify women as underage who were described as lured to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion under the pretense of giving massages for money, then pressured into sex acts as well. A Balkan sex slave Epstein allegedly boasted about purchasing with cash payment by mail. Epstein coaxed his accusers into anonymity to describe claims about years as a teenage sex toy.

One person was injured in Visso when rubble from collapsed buildings tumbled into the streets. The civil protection agency initially reported one injured, with no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. Power is out and emergency crews are waiting. The mayor of Castel Santangelo sul Nera, a tiny town north of the hard-hit areas from the previous quake, reported the damage. Edit by Reldra for this reason. Edit by Reldra for this reason.

Bill Weld's backwards endorsement of Hillary against the backdrop of addressing an electorate torn by so-called party candidates they cannot enthusiastically support. Speaking about Republicans, the president should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. After careful observation and reflection, I believe that if Donald Trump is elected President of the United States, he will not be able to handle pressure and criticism, becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently in the duties of office. I wonder about the effect on Libertarian Party members who feel unfortunate about being forced to choose Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters should look in the mirror and realize how repulsive they voted for the lulz, which ensured a Clinton presidency if they didn't support the establishment fleeing from Kali. Check - don't pretend to be libertarian if you're not libertarian. Here's what this supposed libertarian ticket is endorsing: the least libertarian candidates ever, making people fear a bunch of doo-doo feces in this thread. Voting for Trump isn't about standing up to the establishment or supporting Veritas or anything WikiLeaks revealed. The point I'm convinced of is that if Hillary wins this election, women in America will be wearing hijabs during her presidency, and the draft will return for war with Russia and China. Trump isn't a politician, and the point is that I don't think that's what a president should be. That doesn't mean he hasn't been involved in politics his whole life, but as president, the values of America are instilled in his heart. America's mentality is that Hillary wants to increase Muslim refugees - the ones murdering and raping women in Europe. The ones who aren't Islamic, whatever. Hillary wants amnesty and open borders. That's great - lots of Colombian drug lords will be sending people across the border into our country. That's her fancy tax plans for college and jobs that Trump makes."
Reldra,2016-10-27T02:54:48.091+03:00,abovetopsecret.com,Fake,Powerful quakes hit Italy within hours.,"For years I've been into UFOs, believing mostly in nothing anymore because most of the stuff is faked, at least the exciting CGI. The reason I'm posting this is because of something that happened this summer during a camping trip to Possum Kingdom Lake in West Texas. Robert, on this trip, was a single guy I married following our trip. We went canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, and snorkeling, camping beneath the stars in a tent, star gazing, and eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. Robert and his friends were also together on that chilly, moonless night, tucked in our sleeping bags in a spot elevated from distractions, giving us excellent vision of the sky. We had partook of herb and drank beer daily, consuming 3-4 beers daily until nightfall, when we were tuckered out and ready for nothing but sleep from the heat. West Texas campsite was accessed by boat rental where we canoed and paddled to a rugged, rocky peninsula with cliffs about 200 feet taller than where we camped by the cliffs over the water. Looking for the perfect spot and looking through binoculars, I pointed them up and finally focused the binoculars on what I was following - a slightly larger than satellite, transparent or semi-transparent, faint bluish looking sphere or bubble moving at a speed slightly faster than a satellite, going faster and slower than plane/jet traffic. I estimated it was going south, passing the binoculars back and forth. I assumed it was a satellite - not exciting stuff, I can't help but notice. Coming from the east on course, it was close in altitude, getting close enough for comfort. At least from the east, it shot a bluish beam southbound. It wasn't laser-like - I don't know how to describe it. It was V-shaped like a beam from a flashlight that shot and lasted maybe a second. It was a positive flash from the southbound object, going westward in the direction east of us, making a turn going in our direction. It flashed - I didn't think much about the 90-degree turn going from its path west-southwest about 30 degrees. I'm guessing it abruptly turned without anything like a plane would. It struck me as odd - no curving involved, just dim in the distance, staying in a straight line to its intended destination. Of course, I was thinking it flashed that beam, but nope, it changed speed and directions. The rest I'm not accurate about, but it was sharp and unheard of for years. Though I wasn't talked about this in tabloids for years, I am 100% honest - I didn't expect to finally get to sleep. I don't know what time it was - maybe 2-3 AM when Robert woke me up because of footsteps. I don't know what could have caused us to get up. I guess, heheh, I listened to branches, gravel, and rocks moving beneath whatever it was. Well, I finally went to sleep. I'll admit, yeah, we did partake, but it wasn't a vacation where I was paranoid. I guess our bread and peanut butter went missing - the bread's plastic wrapper and the bread itself were gone, which was creepy. Years later, my boss told me a fun thing about peanut butter and bread going missing when we camped by the river. I was determined it was a raccoon or something regular like that. Days later on the forum with spectacular claims daily, my older brother told me about years of camping in a tent underneath the starry sky at Caddo Lake in East Texas in the spring, looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees, talking about kids looking for flying saucers. That's the entire sky in our backyard thing from the fifties heyday where we stared at the sky from a pickup. He mentioned the bluish sphere years later at Possum Kingdom Lake - the entire time I wasn't talkative, maybe 10 minutes, mentioning the binoculars. I was amazed, I mean, it was nothing, though it quietly slid across the sky and disappeared behind trees. My brother was never a believer who landed to change his mind about regular satellites afterwards. Coming to this lurking thread, the guy saw the exact same thing - a slightly V-shaped flashlight-looking beam from a blue sphere turning away. I'm feeling like Robert witnessed the sphere I denied. He hardly talked about anything else the trip, assuming a bunch of guys were taking pictures. I didn't mean any harm telling Robert that Robert was crazy - I didn't think much about the thing. If I was kidding, you'd think he'd have said he wasn't wanting anyone to know. Edit by Recrisp for this reason."

Eyewitness accounts have been used in science for years. Newton used eyewitness accounts in his Principia when talking about comets. His theory of comets was recorded from sightings around the world. One boy described a comet, though it wasn't verified. To verify the credibility of eyewitness accounts, Newton based his theory of comets and equations of gravity on eyewitness accounts. Are eyewitness accounts unreliable? Newton's theories are also used for meteorites. Wiki says: 'Although meteors have been observed since ancient times as an astronomical phenomenon, it was not until the early 19th century that they were recognized as being of extraterrestrial origin. Prior to that time, they were explained as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, connected to stories of rocks falling from the sky.' Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite in Weston, Connecticut. Silliman believed the meteor was of cosmic origin. Meteors attract attention from astronomers during spectacular meteor storms. In the eastern United States, thousands of meteors were observed radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant point moved with the stars, staying within the constellation Leo. Astute observers saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky called the radiant. Science never uses eyewitness accounts, you say? Also, here's a list of published papers and studies on UFOs that offers a list of articles, papers, and monographs on UFOs (UAPs) published in professional journals and specialty publications. Polls of professional and amateur astronomers, respectively, have shown whether UFOs exist. Finally, there are PhD dissertations and academic publications on UFOs in peer-reviewed literature published by academics who have proposed, studied, and supported non-prosaic explanations for UFOs. There aren't just non-prosaic explanations for UFOs alone that lends credence to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred from UFO sightings and probes. The wind was windy, and the wind was knocking around a round orb that passed, going against the wind, then slowed and sped up. Can any scientist explain UFOs - unidentified objects in the sky, aerial phenomena in the sky that avoid radar, outrun planes, and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction? For years, UFO sightings can't be explained by any scientist. These are the same things Newton used for comets - eyewitness accounts. The same for meteorites. Here's to eyewitness accounts."

Peace of God be with you, my dear readers. I'm suspicious that Indiana is practically leaving voters, especially African Americans, with no possibility to vote in the presidential election following the vice presidential Republican nominee being the governor of that state, Mike Pence. Please see this: Patriot Majority alleges that the investigation and raid are political moves by Lawson, closely tied to Mike Pence, who pushed the voter fraud conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside Donald Trump. We've seen nothing but partisan activity from the Secretary of State and police to buck the successful voter registration drive that's happening. This is an attempt to shut down the voter registration efforts by the governor. The governor's staff is aware and involved in what's happening, and it fits the Trump-Pence narrative that black neighborhoods vote multiple times. Things like this situation aren't fully clarified until the following day after the general election, when Trump lost Indiana by a margin of votes, blocking voters from being able to express their decision freely. This operation was carefully designed as a Republican strategy to excuse fraud and justify arbitrary measures to prevent Americans from electing the president they want. This is a political boycott of the general election. Please check this red alert for voters who oppose Donald Trump. Carefully monitor the behavior and decisions of Republican governors who favor their candidate over the successful voter registration drive that's happening - this is an attempt to shut them down. Please check this thread to discuss the operation and also invite members of the ATS community to report any irregularities taking place to assure our elected president has the support of the majority. Thousands of Americans are going to be deprived of their vote through voter registration drives across the country, which have a protocol that subjects them to investigations. Huffington Post reported that the investigation seems extraordinary - an investigation into potential technical violations of obscure regulations governing third-party voter registration groups.

People with Asperger's tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's case makes sense considering his businesses, although he invested his father's money in business deals and business ventures. Trump's mental health diagnosis of Asperger's could explain why he makes mistakes at his super advanced age. It could also account for his behavior since he wasn't trained to interact at an equal level when interacting with others. The New York Times focused on Trump's fears of making blunders, his fear of losing status, and being embarrassed publicly. He doesn't do well publicly due to his disability. As a public speaker, he makes gaffes accidentally. Donald stated he got married, which means he knows his weaknesses. People with Asperger's don't often get married due to relationship difficulties."

Master of the estate, Coach Jonathan barely felt the bumps. 'Don't get thrown out the window!' Eleanor exclaimed. 'How grand! Isn't this a grand trip?' She was smiling and snuggling closer to Jonathan on the leather seat. 'The fog, though - no moon or stars tonight.' She pulled the curtain aside slightly with her gloved hand and peered mournfully out the window. White mist obscured everything - you could hardly see the tops of trees. A bump jostled them closely. Eleanor squealed. Jonathan's brow drew up. 'Driver! Everything alright?' 'I beg your pardon, sir. I fear we're at a fork in the ways. There's a house ahead - I'll check. Sturbridge Village, sir. Can't see. Sorry, the fog's rolling in.' 'That's fine, sir. Don't worry.' 'Soup, Jonathan?' Eleanor asked. 'Well, it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment.' A few cheerful minutes of cooling down, Jonathan thought. The coach trundled up to a well-maintained stone building with gables and wrought-iron gates. Oil lanterns hung from black hooks on the gables, glowed dimly in the fog. Additional lanterns spilled pools of yellow-orange light on the cobblestone drive. 'The house!' Eleanor gasped at the massive shape. 'How beautiful, Jonathan!' 'Indeed, nothing like it.' A well-dressed footman dashed down the stairs to the coach door. With white-gloved hands, Eleanor peered out and flashed a smile. Jonathan accepted the man's hand and descended. The driver was speaking quietly to the footman when an older man emerged from the oak door of the house. Jonathan descended the steps as the older butler bowed. 'Eleanor, Jonathan, welcome to Anne Union Keyes Estate. Mister Walker, at your service. The master of the estate has invited you for a meal.' The butler had a British accent. 'Jonathan, sir, you've arrived unannounced, but Herr von Graeff enjoys entertaining. We've been notified of your arrival and are honored.' He gestured toward the polished steps. 'Eleanor, do you mind if we proceed without hesitation? We're staying for dinner.' 'Delighted!' she squealed, and they headed into the house. They were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man Jonathan estimated to be in his seventies. His hair was fully white, with creases of age showing on his face and hands. He was tall and straight-backed, moving proudly despite the stiffness of his movements with a cane. Jonathan shook the man's hand - his grip was firm as someone half his age. 'Welcome!' he said warmly, with a Jonathan-detected German accent. 'Gottfried Hansjürgen von Graeff. Please, you're welcome!' The man's eyes sparkled. Jonathan shrugged. 'Thank you, Herr von Graeff. I'm Jonathan Rockport, and my fiancée Eleanor Harrington. We're traveling the highway, trying to reach Sturbridge Village. We were planning to stay and continue along the river.' 'Well, Sturbridge Village,' Herr von Graeff pronounced the town's name with a curious sound, 'is at least fifteen miles away. Why don't you join us for dinner and stay tonight? You can resume your journey tomorrow - no trouble at all. I'm a generous host.' Herr von Graeff continued: 'I must ask - business meetings in Massachusetts? The river area is a wonderful town. The railway is esteemed - the Borden branch line.' Jonathan nodded slowly. 'The railway has been a smashing success, in fact. I have a Borden appointment - a business proposition with an entrepreneur.' 'Excellent!' exclaimed Herr von Graeff. 'I always enjoy conversing with businessmen. Americans always have such interesting ideas. Please, let's continue our conversation over dinner. Mister Walker?' He was addressing the butler. 'The dining hall, Herr von Graeff.'"

I'll pass along something my dad experienced years ago, hoping others have experienced something similar. Some interesting background: my dad is a pilot with 30+ years experience flying in every manner - civilian, military, and commercial aircraft. He's naturally a humble individual, never boasting or prone to exaggeration. Pilots are wired to be logical, mathematical, and mechanical, but also supreme skeptics when it comes to things supernatural or speculative. He's always been concerned with preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry over wild tales. On a trip, he flew a commercial flight to Mexico. Over a beer, I casually mentioned the trip. He cocked an eyebrow and replied, 'I can't explain it.' I gave him my attention. During a layover, the pilot went to dinner, walking along the beach, when he noticed something distant moving in a fixed vector at constant speed. He was watching and wondering about the distance and elevation, thinking satellite or high-flying aircraft - nothing out of the ordinary. Then it completely reversed direction 180 degrees and whizzed out of sight in less than a second. His response: 'It was a UFO.' I cocked an eyebrow. I don't use that word lightly, but what I witnessed utterly defies the laws of aerodynamics I'm familiar with. I'm aware of no aircraft - military or otherwise - that has those abilities. I can't explain it, and that's all I'm willing to say. In contrast, I was also watching a campy Fox program reporting on the government harboring aliens at some point, talking about an installation in the mountains of Nevada - Area 51. That's supposedly a landing zone for UFOs. My dad was laughing, going from the couch, and replied, 'I can't say if they're landing UFOs there, but there's total buzz about that's what I can relate to.' He hopes others have similar experiences. Thanks for reading."

WikiLeaks shows Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign gave speeches to Goldman Sachs and Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank was 'done mostly for political reasons' by Congress during the crisis.

NASA will begin testing a wing design that can change shape during flight by bending to increase yaw stability, reduce rudder size, and decrease drag. Boeing will introduce wingtips that fold on the ground to allow aircraft to fit existing gates with longer wingspan. NASA will begin testing a spanwise adaptive wing with shape-memory alloy actuators in the wingtip area to bend the tips. The SMA actuators activate when heated electrically, without hydraulic lines. The actuators are spring-loaded. NASA is flying an area called Ptera UAV with an inch wingspan. The outer inches are moving degrees. Ptera appears to have rudder authority. The idea behind this is that wingtips angled in a certain way can provide benefits. Boeing will introduce folding wings for commercial aviation when their airliner enters service. These devices will become commonplace in future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The wingspan of today's aircraft is optimized to lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding tips on the ground keeps larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. NASA is investigating whether this can also be done with folding wing tips during flight for fuel efficiency. The spanwise adaptive wing concept has been tested on the ground and in flight through rapid feasibility assessment in NASA's Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project. The goal is angling the outboard wing sections to increase yaw stability and control, reduce rudder size, and reduce tail drag."

Astronomers believe the signals emanating from a cluster of stars could be aliens trying to contact the universe. There's a new study from the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific that analyzed odd beams from stars. A fraction of the millions observed show these bizarre beacons. The paper's authors, Ermanno Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, conclude that aliens have been detected. The signals are in the shape of extraterrestrial intelligence signals, as predicted in their publication, which is in agreement with their hypothesis. Borra and Trottier also note that their findings align with the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since this mysterious activity occurred in only a tiny fraction of stars. Their hypothesis also suggests intelligent life could force a sophisticated optical beacon using radio waves to reveal their existence. Mods: If this is a duplicate, please delete and lock. Apparently, signals have been detected from stars fitting the hypothesized parameters they established for extraterrestrial intelligence. The stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life, since these stars are in an area fitting the parameters they're using for evidence of these claims.

I guess my question is relating to quantum computing. Since qubits make quantum computers, can qubits act as transistors in usual computing? Are transistors quantum? The question is: can a transistor act as an extra layer of circuitry for reading a single transistor? I mean, can a transistor operate when it gets voltage, and no voltage means the transistor is in one state, and when it gets voltage, it's in another state? Couldn't there be voltage for an extra on/off state - like half voltage for an on/off state? It's essentially a fake qubit scenario. Could additional transistors make a determination about whether a transistor is appearing to be in an on/off state? Couldn't the circuit of transistors determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as on/off by checking voltage? IDK, please answer. I'm drunk and a stupid idiot, but I'm a laymen idiot. Thanks for hearing me out. I'm drunk and pondering things. Don't take advantage of my state to damage stuff. How does circuitry store data? If the circuit doesn't have the advantage of storing bits like conventional technology that's highly refined, what advantage does a qubit have? Isn't it that qubits store and process? In quantum computing, quantum computing has key features. An ordinary computer has bits, registers, logic gates, and algorithms - these all have analogous features in a quantum computer. Instead of bits, a quantum computer has quantum bits (qubits). What's intriguing is that qubits can store zero and one - a qubit can store zero and one and zero, and infinite values between and multiple states can store multiple values. This sounds confusing - like a particle or wave, Schrödinger's cat alive or dead, a car, bicycle, or bus. In gentler terms, numbers and qubits store a physics concept called superposition. Like waves, a third wave contains both originals. If you blow a flute or pipe, it fills with a standing wave. The wave has a fundamental frequency - the basic note you're playing - but it also has lots of overtones and harmonics (higher-frequency multiples of the fundamental). The wave in the pipe contains multiple waves simultaneously. They're together as a combined wave that includes everything. Qubits in superposition represent multiple states and multiple numeric values simultaneously. A quantum computer can store multiple numbers and process them simultaneously, working in serial (a series of things in sequence) parallel (multiple things at the same state and moment). In measuring, the words collapse the states and give an answer to the problem. Estimates suggest quantum computers will have the ability to parallel process millions of times faster than a conventional computer. If correctly built, a quantum computer could be smaller and more energy efficient than a massive parallel computer."
