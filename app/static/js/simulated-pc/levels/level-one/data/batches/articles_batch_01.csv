Reasoning With Facts,2016-10-29T08:47:11.259+03:00,100percentfedup.com,Real,Attorney General Loretta Lynch pleads the fifth.,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch plead the fifth. The administration is blocking a congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course, she needs to plead the fifth - she can't recall, refuses to answer, or plain deflects every question. It's straight corruption at its finest. They're talking about covering their ass. Loretta Lynch plead the fifth to avoid incriminating herself regarding payments to Iran. Corrupt to the core. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress into the Obama administration's secret efforts to send Iran billions in cash, prompting accusations that Lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself. The payments to lawmakers and communications obtained by the Washington beacon show that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) initially presented Lynch with a series of questions about the cash payment to Iran that was approved and delivered in October. In response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch's behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any information about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney general's office is unacceptable and provides evidence that Lynch has essentially plead the fifth to refuse to respond to inquiries about her role in providing cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, according to Rubio and Pompeo in a follow-up letter to Lynch."

Trump's 7-point plan to reform healthcare begins with a bombshell.,"Healthcare reform will make America great again, since all Americans suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This legislation was passed through partisan votes in both the House and Senate, and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in American history. It has tragically and predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition, and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised economic uncertainty for every single person residing in this country, and it appears that Obamacare will collapse under the weight of its own damage. Done by the Democrats, President Obama, and aided by the Supreme Court, this repair work - unless a new president and Republican Congress make an effort - will require much-needed market reforms to the healthcare industry. Congress must act as the elected representatives in both the House and Senate to repeal Obamacare. The elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless they want to. They should modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state, allowing true competition into the insurance market, which will bring down insurance costs and consumer satisfaction. They should allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions, so why wouldn't Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? They should allow individuals to use health savings accounts (HSAs), enabling market insurance coverage opportunities for companies and individuals who also slip through the cracks and simply cannot afford insurance. They should require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations that receive tax dollars from the government, enabling basic Medicaid to ensure that no person requiring healthcare coverage is left behind."

Prince claimed that the State Department emails were damning - criminal money laundering. The fact that Hillary went to that sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein - Bill Clinton went there 20 times, Hillary Clinton went at least 6 times. These aren't just garbage emails about criminal activity by Hillary and her immediate circle. Democratic members of Congress find it disgusting that the FBI isn't going public. If they don't reopen this investigation, they don't do anything, and there won't be timely indictments, Prince explained. He believes he is well-placed to make these claims."

The case should 'drain the swamp.' FBI Director James Comey announced that the agency has reviewed Hillary Clinton's emails discovered in an unrelated case and concluded not to prosecute Clinton. The FBI's original investigation into her private server stands, Comey informed Congress in October. The agency found in an unrelated case additional emails from Clinton's time running the State Department. Since Comey's letter, FBI investigative teams have been working around the clock to process this volume of emails. Comey sent a follow-up letter to Congress saying the communications from Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State have not changed the conclusion of the case. The emails were purportedly from ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, using a laptop he shared with his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, for sexting with an apparently underage female."

The president wants to ensure that students know the university remains committed to its responsibility as a school, apparently committed to education, discovery, intellectual honesty, diversity, equity, and inclusion for all members of the university community. The election coverage was an opportunity to visit with students and staff about the results, watching the event at Ginsberg Center in Michigan Union to absorb the results of yesterday's election and its implications, and to discern the long-term impact on the university and the nation. In the immediate aftermath of this close and highly contentious election, we must embrace our responsibility as a university community - a responsibility rooted in our commitment to education, discovery, intellectual honesty, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Together, we must engage respectfully across ideological differences with those who feel marginalized, threatened, or unwelcome as we pursue knowledge and understanding. As always, our students, faculty, and staff are at the heart of the University of Michigan. Reports indicate that members of the community are offering students planning a vigil tonight on the Diag. The Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources for faculty seeking to cultivate classroom environments responsive to national issues. Also, everyone should be aware of plans for events at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy holding a post-election discussion in Weill Hall's Annenberg Auditorium with speakers including former Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson, and Marina Whitman.

Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a post-election dialogue about impact, perspective-taking, and moving forward. This event is part of Student Life Professional Development Conference at Michigan League's Henderson Room. Schools, colleges, and offices across campus are planning similar events as well. Thank you to everyone for helping us come together. Anyone scheduling an election-related event should add it to the University of Michigan events calendar. We proudly embrace the opportunities for our students, faculty, and staff at this great public research university. Governed by elections, we often see times of great change. Our values have been shaped over the course of many years, and our mission remains as essential to society as ever. We serve Michigan and the world through our preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving, and applying knowledge and art, and our academic values include developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. We look forward to working together to advance this mission in service to the public good, ensuring that the University of Michigan is always welcoming to all members of our society.

Tuesday's vote shows 98% of precincts reporting that Hillary Clinton got 6 million fewer votes than Barack Obama did in 2012. The conclusion is that Clinton failed to reach the White House because she failed to energize the Democratic base. The truth is that she underperformed relative to Obama's totals in key Midwestern states: Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Clinton virtually matched Obama in battleground states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What's more, she actually surpassed Obama's vote total in Florida, the country's biggest swing state. In 2012, Obama won Florida with 4.2 million votes; Clinton brings that question.

Here's how McNaughton describes the painting: Against the background of a darkening sky, the presidents of the United States gather at the White House to commemorate a great event. In the hand corner of the painting sits Obama with his head bowed, appearing distraught and hopeless as he contemplates the future. The other presidents console him, looking in his direction. Modern presidents seem to have done well, while modern presidents are seemingly oblivious to anything, congratulating themselves on their great accomplishments. Paper and trash are blowing in the wind - crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, whispers of the Constitution beneath Obama's foot. Barack Obama has forgotten them.

She's sick and unfit to serve even one term, but I supported her anyhow because she's a Democrat with a vagina and had a chance of winning the presidency. I signed a petition saying Trump didn't win, but Hillary should get the vote. Okay, let's address this. Hillary should get the vote, but it isn't an Electoral College situation. This isn't an awful thing. In fact, it's an awful thing to think about - the great Electoral College protects the importance of every vote and is also uniquely American. It demonstrates, once again, the brilliance of our founding fathers. She's going to get more actual votes cast than Trump. Here's why: votes are counted, but the votes cast in certain states don't count absentee ballots unless the outstanding absentee ballots are larger than the state's margin of difference. If the margin of votes counted exceeds the absentee ballots outstanding, the state doesn't tabulate the outstanding absentee ballots because they wouldn't influence the election results. So millions of absentee ballots aren't counted every election cycle. Who votes by absentee ballot? Students, overseas military, businesspeople on trips, etc. Historically, the breakout of absentee ballots has been heavily Republican. In 2000, Gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes. Liberals screamed bloody murder. Yet there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone whose breakout yields a 2-to-1 Republican vote advantage. Had Bush gotten a 2-to-1 vote margin from California's uncounted absentee ballots alone, Bush would have won Gore's popular vote victory. Headline that in the New York Times or on NBC Nightly News! You're kidding. You're getting upset about the popular vote/lose electoral college scenario instead of thanking God that someone else in California can't determine every election. The Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in voting proclivities among states and regions - farmers in farm country, importers and exporters on the shore, all are equal to Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. Without it, the shortcomings of the popular vote would make it meaningless in heavily populated states, and vice versa. The Electoral College ensures the country's entire population isn't subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of populous states. American Thinker."

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,21stcenturywire.com,Fake,DNC party corruption: Clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced DNC consultant.,"21st Century Wire: Patrick Henningsen of 21st Century Wire says that as the soap opera drags on, it's becoming evident that the Russian government didn't hack the DNC. Moscow isn't feeding John Podesta's emails to WikiLeaks, despite being deeply invested in the official conspiracy theory. It's a hard pill to swallow for the White House and Hillary Clinton campaign, who are married to the idea that Putin is hacking elections. In response, the president is weighing tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status for Russian envoys, and deploying newly developed malicious cyber-activity tools. Joe Biden wants to take action, threatening Moscow by saying, 'We're sending a message' about their capacity. It seems that ever since Washington started issuing threats to Russia, US-Russian relations have been trending downward. The defense industry and power struggles have infected America's left-wing with a formerly right-wing neoconservative hawks for war stance - holdouts that have infected America's left-wing as a firm plank of the Democratic Party platform, evidenced by Hillary Clinton's constant anti-Russian rhetoric this election cycle. The White House and Clinton have transformed Democrats into the vanguard of Washington's anti-Russia movement. Josh Rogin of the Washington Post reports that the Clinton campaign plans to escalate rhetoric against Russia if Trump wins. Trump has suggested Russia hacked Clinton's private server to release emails, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic surrogates bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone paying attention knows the Russian hack talking point is purely political. Who's paying attention these days? You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party's hardcore anti-Russian strategy to President Vladimir Putin's mild, passing remark about Donald Trump's GOP primary success - at which point Trump's political opponents targeted his words, comparing him to a dictator. They never pass up an opportunity to score political points. President Obama has acted on intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of a 'bromance.' 'You've had a career idealizing Ronald Reagan, but your party's nominee for president is kissing up to Vladimir Putin,' Obama said in October at a Clinton rally in Miami. Backed by Obama, the White House and Clinton are pressing ahead, blaming Russia for controversial DNC leaks and also for hacking election systems in Arizona - a charge devoid of evidence, full of innuendo and speculation. The media's coverage of this issue has been deceptive from the onset. A leading example is the release entitled 'Russian Hackers Targeted Arizona Election System.' The cocksure headline in the first paragraph always sounds definitive: 'Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona,' the FBI alerted Arizona. 'Russians were behind the assault on the election system,' the state said. But it advanced quickly into retreat and a zone of uncertainty. The bureau described the threat as credible, but the scale was unclear. Matt Roberts, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan's result, said Reagan shut down the state's voter registration system, but nothing indicates hackers compromised any state system, county system, or stole any username, password, or single election official information from Gila County. At no point was there evidence - ever - just ambiguous statements from cyber security officials who agree it looks like Russian government-directed hack. American politicians are callous enough to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to serve short-term political ambitions. American political life has arrived at a cul-de-sac - translated from French as 'dead end' - where politicians in power are so insecure they makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories during a national election cycle. It's a depressing prospect, seeing a presidential election behind Clinton's wild, hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and WikiLeaks. The White House and Obama administration have formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and high-profile individuals like Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, then giving them to WikiLeaks. Queue the national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) on the Homeland Security Committee spouted that Russia will face consequences if Moscow orchestrated the hacks. 'Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it unless the United States can upend Putin's calculus with a diplomatic, political, cyber, and economic response,' Washington Post technology editor Ellen Nakashima reports. The evidence seems to rest on corporate alleged Russian government hacks by the cyber security company CrowdStrike, but actual specifics are never meant to be revealed - we're just supposed to take private firm CrowdStrike's word for it."
Shawn Helton,2016-11-04T00:03:00.000+02:00,21stcenturywire.com,Fake,Partners in crime: Goldman Sachs and the Clintons on Wall Street.,"21st Century Wire reports that the biggest revelation from WikiLeaks' epic trove of emails was covered by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger. WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes the whole collection reveals. WikiLeaks reveals outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urging John Podesta, advisor to President Barack Obama, to pressure Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar for providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL (Islamic State/ISIS) and other radical Sunni groups. This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation was knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from Gulf states while Secretary Clinton and President Obama were aware they were funding ISIS, Nusra, Al-Qaeda Syria, and other Takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. In addition to Clinton's foundation money from Gulf monarchies, this infographic from Conservative Review validates what 21st Century Wire has been saying since the ISIS crisis began, according to Fox News and FBI sources."

Any doubts can finally be put to rest - it seems Europe's technocrats have surrendered to their program of Euro red scare brainwashing. The resolution compares Russian organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS and also claims Russian trolls are challenging Democratic values. Anti-Russia legislation worth millions in funding will implement anti-Russia programs because bureaucrats believe they must counter this grave threat to democracy. The touch of oxymoronic irony isn't lost - parliamentarians are plotting, claiming Europe is at war with Russia. The whole thing is a hysterical notion that Russian propaganda is damaging the minds of Europeans on a whole new level of crazy. I wonder why millions of Britons voted to leave this summer? The reality is that views aired by presenters, contributors, and pundits - both Westerners and Russians - are the reason RT's audience ratings are growing. What's being presented is resonating with international audiences because RT's reports are more accurate and truthful than the monoliths like BBC, CNN, and other establishment outlets spending all their effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover up a plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally. Western media is killing its relationship with domestic audiences in an age of people talking to the public, assuming they're fools. The network has been shaped for years, with Western moguls playing catch-up, albeit in vain. It's sunset for Goebbels, hamstrung by layers of management committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of the state. This star chamber is a tangled web of subterfuge obsessed with controlling and disseminating information in an environment so dysfunctional it's simply unable to provide authentic journalism or truth to power. It's incredibly ironic that while working for Western propaganda, this phase of the regime ideologues in Brussels attacks the faceless force behind the latest xenophobic resolution. Washington, Paris, and London are hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions as a disservice to European businesses and workers losing trade with Russia. Once Donald Trump is sworn in, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis will disintegrate. This latest Brussels effort is a last-ditch attempt to damage Europe's neo-McCarthyites and plot an escape door from the disastrous coup d'état in Ukraine, NATO's hubris in the Baltics, and the EU's migrant crisis debacle. Tens of millions of euros have been laundered through US pseudo-NGO White Helmets in Syria. These are just a few chapters in modern diplomatic history of abject failure and incompetent foreign policy underpinned by backward, confused ideology. There's no coherent Western reporting on this subject - it seems Western mainstream media is too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. Following an international vote, MEPs in Strasbourg voted on a non-legislative resolution that calls to respond to information warfare from Russia. Sputnik agency is alleged to be among the tools of hostile propaganda. Parliament's resolution demonstrates political degradation with regard to the idea of democracy in the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin, commenting on the vote, pointed out that everyone tries to lecture Russia about democracy, yet European lawmakers resort to restrictions on issues they can't approach for discussion with solid arguments - the only ones they can present. Putin added that he hopes Western efforts to counter Russian propaganda won't involve restrictions. The president congratulated Sputnik journalists on the vote. MEPs who supported the resolution on strategic communication to counteract propaganda by third parties were voting, with some abstaining. Polish European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) member Anna Fotyga alleged that Moscow aims to distort truth, provoke doubt, divide North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit institutions, and incite fear and uncertainty among citizens. She suggests Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU states, causing disintegration of the bloc. Russia is accused of information warfare. Entities like RT channel, Sputnik agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency, and Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund are alleged to be among the threatening propaganda tools. The document places Russian organizations alongside terrorist groups like Islamic State (formerly ISIS/ISIL) and also mentions trolls from Russia who challenge Democratic values. The EU establishment measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat means investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media. It also suggests stronger cooperation with NATO strategic communication. Sputnik appealed to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), international journalists' organizations, NGOs, and Reporters Without Borders about measures it considers interference with freedom of speech. The resolution hits straight at the respected Sputnik agency with the aim of stopping its activity. The resolution bluntly contradicts the EU's human rights and freedom of the press norms, reads a letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. The parliamentary debate that preceded the vote saw MEPs campaigning for the resolution to wage information war against Russia, putting the EU on a collision course traveling faster than a jet fighter. The alleged aim is to split Europe from the Kremlin's sphere of influence between countries."

He was contemptuous of sex-trade workers, street walkers, and drug addicts. Concern grows about Soros-linked voting machines. Sixteen states are using balloting equipment from a company tied to leftist billionaire Edmund Kozak. October concerns are growing over revelations that voting machines in several states are linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest for a nationless, borderless global state. UK-based Smartmatic company posted a flowchart of voting machines in several states, including battleground states Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN official who sits on the board of Soros' Open Society Foundations. Since the flowchart disappeared, Smartmatic is raising questions about the status of Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it's deployed in elections. Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough - he also has ties to the Clintons through consulting firms and the National Association of Secretaries of State. Smartmatic is on the list of federally certified providers of election systems in several states with contested equipment. Smartmatic bragged about providing voting machines for elections.

Daniel Greenfield: Don't forget that Bill Clinton didn't just keep company with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein outrageously got away with shocking allegations against Epstein that surfaced after the conclusion of an FBI probe and civil suits by victims. For example, one claim involves a 12-year-old French girl delivered as a birthday present. Feds identify women as underage who were described as lured to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion under the pretense of giving massages for money, then pressured into sex acts as well. A Balkan sex slave Epstein allegedly boasted about purchasing with cash payment by mail. Epstein coaxed his accusers into anonymity to describe claims about years as a teenage sex toy. Victim Virginia Roberts produced detailed accounts."
