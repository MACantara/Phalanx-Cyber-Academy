Bill Weld's backwards endorsement of Hillary against the backdrop of addressing an electorate torn by so-called party candidates they cannot enthusiastically support. Speaking about Republicans, the president should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. After careful observation and reflection, I believe that if Donald Trump is elected President of the United States, he will not be able to handle pressure and criticism, becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently in the duties of office. I wonder about the effect on Libertarian Party members who feel unfortunate about being forced to choose Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters should look in the mirror and realize how repulsive they voted for the lulz, which ensured a Clinton presidency if they didn't support the establishment fleeing from Kali. Check - don't pretend to be libertarian if you're not libertarian. Here's what this supposed libertarian ticket is endorsing: the least libertarian candidates ever, making people fear a bunch of doo-doo feces in this thread. Voting for Trump isn't about standing up to the establishment or supporting Veritas or anything WikiLeaks revealed. The point I'm convinced of is that if Hillary wins this election, women in America will be wearing hijabs during her presidency, and the draft will return for war with Russia and China. Trump isn't a politician, and the point is that I don't think that's what a president should be. That doesn't mean he hasn't been involved in politics his whole life, but as president, the values of America are instilled in his heart. America's mentality is that Hillary wants to increase Muslim refugees - the ones murdering and raping women in Europe. The ones who aren't Islamic, whatever. Hillary wants amnesty and open borders. That's great - lots of Colombian drug lords will be sending people across the border into our country. That's her fancy tax plans for college and jobs that Trump makes."
Reldra,2016-10-27T02:54:48.091+03:00,abovetopsecret.com,Fake,Powerful quakes hit Italy within hours.,"For years I've been into UFOs, believing mostly in nothing anymore because most of the stuff is faked, at least the exciting CGI. The reason I'm posting this is because of something that happened this summer during a camping trip to Possum Kingdom Lake in West Texas. Robert, on this trip, was a single guy I married following our trip. We went canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, and snorkeling, camping beneath the stars in a tent, star gazing, and eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. Robert and his friends were also together on that chilly, moonless night, tucked in our sleeping bags in a spot elevated from distractions, giving us excellent vision of the sky. We had partook of herb and drank beer daily, consuming 3-4 beers daily until nightfall, when we were tuckered out and ready for nothing but sleep from the heat. West Texas campsite was accessed by boat rental where we canoed and paddled to a rugged, rocky peninsula with cliffs about 200 feet taller than where we camped by the cliffs over the water. Looking for the perfect spot and looking through binoculars, I pointed them up and finally focused the binoculars on what I was following - a slightly larger than satellite, transparent or semi-transparent, faint bluish looking sphere or bubble moving at a speed slightly faster than a satellite, going faster and slower than plane/jet traffic. I estimated it was going south, passing the binoculars back and forth. I assumed it was a satellite - not exciting stuff, I can't help but notice. Coming from the east on course, it was close in altitude, getting close enough for comfort. At least from the east, it shot a bluish beam southbound. It wasn't laser-like - I don't know how to describe it. It was V-shaped like a beam from a flashlight that shot and lasted maybe a second. It was a positive flash from the southbound object, going westward in the direction east of us, making a turn going in our direction. It flashed - I didn't think much about the 90-degree turn going from its path west-southwest about 30 degrees. I'm guessing it abruptly turned without anything like a plane would. It struck me as odd - no curving involved, just dim in the distance, staying in a straight line to its intended destination. Of course, I was thinking it flashed that beam, but nope, it changed speed and directions. The rest I'm not accurate about, but it was sharp and unheard of for years. Though I wasn't talked about this in tabloids for years, I am 100% honest - I didn't expect to finally get to sleep. I don't know what time it was - maybe 2-3 AM when Robert woke me up because of footsteps. I don't know what could have caused us to get up. I guess, heheh, I listened to branches, gravel, and rocks moving beneath whatever it was. Well, I finally went to sleep. I'll admit, yeah, we did partake, but it wasn't a vacation where I was paranoid. I guess our bread and peanut butter went missing - the bread's plastic wrapper and the bread itself were gone, which was creepy. Years later, my boss told me a fun thing about peanut butter and bread going missing when we camped by the river. I was determined it was a raccoon or something regular like that. Days later on the forum with spectacular claims daily, my older brother told me about years of camping in a tent underneath the starry sky at Caddo Lake in East Texas in the spring, looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees, talking about kids looking for flying saucers. That's the entire sky in our backyard thing from the fifties heyday where we stared at the sky from a pickup. He mentioned the bluish sphere years later at Possum Kingdom Lake - the entire time I wasn't talkative, maybe 10 minutes, mentioning the binoculars. I was amazed, I mean, it was nothing, though it quietly slid across the sky and disappeared behind trees. My brother was never a believer who landed to change his mind about regular satellites afterwards. Coming to this lurking thread, the guy saw the exact same thing - a slightly V-shaped flashlight-looking beam from a blue sphere turning away. I'm feeling like Robert witnessed the sphere I denied. He hardly talked about anything else the trip, assuming a bunch of guys were taking pictures. I didn't mean any harm telling Robert that Robert was crazy - I didn't think much about the thing. If I was kidding, you'd think he'd have said he wasn't wanting anyone to know. Edit by Recrisp for this reason."

Eyewitness accounts have been used in science for years. Newton used eyewitness accounts in his Principia when talking about comets. His theory of comets was recorded from sightings around the world. One boy described a comet, though it wasn't verified. To verify the credibility of eyewitness accounts, Newton based his theory of comets and equations of gravity on eyewitness accounts. Are eyewitness accounts unreliable? Newton's theories are also used for meteorites. Wiki says: 'Although meteors have been observed since ancient times as an astronomical phenomenon, it was not until the early 19th century that they were recognized as being of extraterrestrial origin. Prior to that time, they were explained as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, connected to stories of rocks falling from the sky.' Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite in Weston, Connecticut. Silliman believed the meteor was of cosmic origin. Meteors attract attention from astronomers during spectacular meteor storms. In the eastern United States, thousands of meteors were observed radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant point moved with the stars, staying within the constellation Leo. Astute observers saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky called the radiant. Science never uses eyewitness accounts, you say? Also, here's a list of published papers and studies on UFOs that offers a list of articles, papers, and monographs on UFOs (UAPs) published in professional journals and specialty publications. Polls of professional and amateur astronomers, respectively, have shown whether UFOs exist. Finally, there are PhD dissertations and academic publications on UFOs in peer-reviewed literature published by academics who have proposed, studied, and supported non-prosaic explanations for UFOs. There aren't just non-prosaic explanations for UFOs alone that lends credence to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred from UFO sightings and probes. The wind was windy, and the wind was knocking around a round orb that passed, going against the wind, then slowed and sped up. Can any scientist explain UFOs - unidentified objects in the sky, aerial phenomena in the sky that avoid radar, outrun planes, and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction? For years, UFO sightings can't be explained by any scientist. These are the same things Newton used for comets - eyewitness accounts. The same for meteorites. Here's to eyewitness accounts."
Sanitizedinfo,2016-10-27T02:54:53.333+03:00,abovetopsecret.com,Fake,Influencing machine: Magnus Olsen's blood.,"Mission voter registration for Trump starts in Indiana. Peace of God be with you, my dear readers. I'm suspicious that Indiana is practically leaving voters, especially African Americans, with no possibility to vote in the presidential election following the vice presidential Republican nominee being the governor of that state, Mike Pence. Please see this: Patriot Majority alleges that the investigation and raid are political moves by Lawson, closely tied to Mike Pence, who pushed the voter fraud conspiracy on the campaign trail alongside Donald Trump. We've seen nothing but partisan activity from the Secretary of State and police to buck the successful voter registration drive that's happening. This is an attempt to shut down the voter registration efforts by the governor. The governor's staff is aware and involved in what's happening, and it fits the Trump-Pence narrative that black neighborhoods vote multiple times. Things like this situation aren't fully clarified until the following day after the general election, when Trump lost Indiana by a margin of votes, blocking voters from being able to express their decision freely. This operation was carefully designed as a Republican strategy to excuse fraud and justify arbitrary measures to prevent Americans from electing the president they want. This is a political boycott of the general election. Please check this red alert for voters who oppose Donald Trump. Carefully monitor the behavior and decisions of Republican governors who favor their candidate over the successful voter registration drive that's happening - this is an attempt to shut them down. Please check this thread to discuss the operation and also invite members of the ATS community to report any irregularities taking place to assure our elected president has the support of the majority. Thousands of Americans are going to be deprived of their vote through voter registration drives across the country, which have a protocol that subjects them to investigations. Huffington Post reported that the investigation seems extraordinary - an investigation into potential technical violations of obscure regulations governing third-party voter registration groups.

People with Asperger's tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's case makes sense considering his businesses, although he invested his father's money in business deals and business ventures. Trump's mental health diagnosis of Asperger's could explain why he makes mistakes at his super advanced age. It could also account for his behavior since he wasn't trained to interact at an equal level when interacting with others. The New York Times focused on Trump's fears of making blunders, his fear of losing status, and being embarrassed publicly. He doesn't do well publicly due to his disability. As a public speaker, he makes gaffes accidentally. Donald stated he got married, which means he knows his weaknesses. People with Asperger's don't often get married due to relationship difficulties."

Master of the estate, Coach Jonathan barely felt the bumps. 'Don't get thrown out the window!' Eleanor exclaimed. 'How grand! Isn't this a grand trip?' She was smiling and snuggling closer to Jonathan on the leather seat. 'The fog, though - no moon or stars tonight.' She pulled the curtain aside slightly with her gloved hand and peered mournfully out the window. White mist obscured everything - you could hardly see the tops of trees. A bump jostled them closely. Eleanor squealed. Jonathan's brow drew up. 'Driver! Everything alright?' 'I beg your pardon, sir. I fear we're at a fork in the ways. There's a house ahead - I'll check. Sturbridge Village, sir. Can't see. Sorry, the fog's rolling in.' 'That's fine, sir. Don't worry.' 'Soup, Jonathan?' Eleanor asked. 'Well, it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment.' A few cheerful minutes of cooling down, Jonathan thought. The coach trundled up to a well-maintained stone building with gables and wrought-iron gates. Oil lanterns hung from black hooks on the gables, glowed dimly in the fog. Additional lanterns spilled pools of yellow-orange light on the cobblestone drive. 'The house!' Eleanor gasped at the massive shape. 'How beautiful, Jonathan!' 'Indeed, nothing like it.' A well-dressed footman dashed down the stairs to the coach door. With white-gloved hands, Eleanor peered out and flashed a smile. Jonathan accepted the man's hand and descended. The driver was speaking quietly to the footman when an older man emerged from the oak door of the house. Jonathan descended the steps as the older butler bowed. 'Eleanor, Jonathan, welcome to Anne Union Keyes Estate. Mister Walker, at your service. The master of the estate has invited you for a meal.' The butler had a British accent. 'Jonathan, sir, you've arrived unannounced, but Herr von Graeff enjoys entertaining. We've been notified of your arrival and are honored.' He gestured toward the polished steps. 'Eleanor, do you mind if we proceed without hesitation? We're staying for dinner.' 'Delighted!' she squealed, and they headed into the house. They were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man Jonathan estimated to be in his seventies. His hair was fully white, with creases of age showing on his face and hands. He was tall and straight-backed, moving proudly despite the stiffness of his movements with a cane. Jonathan shook the man's hand - his grip was firm as someone half his age. 'Welcome!' he said warmly, with a Jonathan-detected German accent. 'Gottfried Hansjürgen von Graeff. Please, you're welcome!' The man's eyes sparkled. Jonathan shrugged. 'Thank you, Herr von Graeff. I'm Jonathan Rockport, and my fiancée Eleanor Harrington. We're traveling the highway, trying to reach Sturbridge Village. We were planning to stay and continue along the river.' 'Well, Sturbridge Village,' Herr von Graeff pronounced the town's name with a curious sound, 'is at least fifteen miles away. Why don't you join us for dinner and stay tonight? You can resume your journey tomorrow - no trouble at all. I'm a generous host.' Herr von Graeff continued: 'I must ask - business meetings in Massachusetts? The river area is a wonderful town. The railway is esteemed - the Borden branch line.' Jonathan nodded slowly. 'The railway has been a smashing success, in fact. I have a Borden appointment - a business proposition with an entrepreneur.' 'Excellent!' exclaimed Herr von Graeff. 'I always enjoy conversing with businessmen. Americans always have such interesting ideas. Please, let's continue our conversation over dinner. Mister Walker?' He was addressing the butler. 'The dining hall, Herr von Graeff.'"

Though there are two weeks until the election, I'm at a loss for words looking at the eighth of things. Well, the landscape leading up to this year's election won't let me rest. ATS, I'm confident in saying this is unprecedented - a wholly unforeseeable revelation and event two years before this election was done. Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States with two weeks remaining in the election. I'm writing a meta-analysis of polls that shows Clinton possessing an insurmountable lead, while Trump enjoys a passionate, enthusiastic base. He's done little to successfully expand his base or find potential means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters. His minimal support shrinks with each passing day, and in the coming weeks I can't handle this world. Frankly, gazing into the allegorical crystal ball, I see threatening clouds gathering on the horizon. These clouds as well portend a storm of epic proportions after the election. The blues after this eighth election will be historic in several ways. This election cycle has broken taboos and lowered the bar for political discourse in unprecedented ways. This season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric has built up great tension atop a powder keg of anger that's seething. Highly volatile passions are flaring among all sides as election results stream into televisions, computers, and phones. People are watching, deeply, deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race. At this climactic moment, the nation is perilously close to critical mass - one spark away from potential disaster. For two years, to some degree, fame has emotionally invested people in the two years leading up to this election to vent their reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion about celebrity Donald Trump."

I'll pass along something my dad experienced years ago, hoping others have experienced something similar. Some interesting background: my dad is a pilot with 30+ years experience flying in every manner - civilian, military, and commercial aircraft. He's naturally a humble individual, never boasting or prone to exaggeration. Pilots are wired to be logical, mathematical, and mechanical, but also supreme skeptics when it comes to things supernatural or speculative. He's always been concerned with preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry over wild tales. On a trip, he flew a commercial flight to Mexico. Over a beer, I casually mentioned the trip. He cocked an eyebrow and replied, 'I can't explain it.' I gave him my attention. During a layover, the pilot went to dinner, walking along the beach, when he noticed something distant moving in a fixed vector at constant speed. He was watching and wondering about the distance and elevation, thinking satellite or high-flying aircraft - nothing out of the ordinary. Then it completely reversed direction 180 degrees and whizzed out of sight in less than a second. His response: 'It was a UFO.' I cocked an eyebrow. I don't use that word lightly, but what I witnessed utterly defies the laws of aerodynamics I'm familiar with. I'm aware of no aircraft - military or otherwise - that has those abilities. I can't explain it, and that's all I'm willing to say. In contrast, I was also watching a campy Fox program reporting on the government harboring aliens at some point, talking about an installation in the mountains of Nevada - Area 51. That's supposedly a landing zone for UFOs. My dad was laughing, going from the couch, and replied, 'I can't say if they're landing UFOs there, but there's total buzz about that's what I can relate to.' He hopes others have similar experiences. Thanks for reading."

NASA will begin testing a wing design that can change shape during flight by bending to increase yaw stability, reduce rudder size, and decrease drag. Boeing will introduce wingtips that fold on the ground to allow aircraft to fit existing gates with longer wingspan. NASA will begin testing a spanwise adaptive wing with shape-memory alloy actuators in the wingtip area to bend the tips. The SMA actuators activate when heated electrically, without hydraulic lines. The actuators are spring-loaded. NASA is flying an area called Ptera UAV with an inch wingspan. The outer inches are moving degrees. Ptera appears to have rudder authority. The idea behind this is that wingtips angled in a certain way can provide benefits. Boeing will introduce folding wings for commercial aviation when their airliner enters service. These devices will become commonplace in future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The wingspan of today's aircraft is optimized to lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding tips on the ground keeps larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. NASA is investigating whether this can also be done with folding wing tips during flight for fuel efficiency. The spanwise adaptive wing concept has been tested on the ground and in flight through rapid feasibility assessment in NASA's Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project. The goal is angling the outboard wing sections to increase yaw stability and control, reduce rudder size, and reduce tail drag."

There's a new study from the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific that analyzed odd beams from stars. A fraction of the millions observed show these bizarre beacons. The paper's authors, Ermanno Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, conclude that aliens have been detected. The signals are in the shape of extraterrestrial intelligence signals, as predicted in their publication, which is in agreement with their hypothesis. Borra and Trottier also note that their findings align with the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since this mysterious activity occurred in only a tiny fraction of stars. Their hypothesis also suggests intelligent life could force a sophisticated optical beacon using radio waves to reveal their existence. Mods: If this is a duplicate, please delete and lock. Apparently, signals have been detected from stars fitting the hypothesized parameters they established for extraterrestrial intelligence.

I guess my question is relating to quantum computing. Since qubits make quantum computers, can qubits act as transistors in usual computing? Are transistors quantum? The question is: can a transistor act as an extra layer of circuitry for reading a single transistor? I mean, can a transistor operate when it gets voltage, and no voltage means the transistor is in one state, and when it gets voltage, it's in another state? Couldn't there be voltage for an extra on/off state - like half voltage for an on/off state? It's essentially a fake qubit scenario. Could additional transistors make a determination about whether a transistor is appearing to be in an on/off state? Couldn't the circuit of transistors determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as on/off by checking voltage? IDK, please answer. I'm drunk and a stupid idiot, but I'm a laymen idiot. Thanks for hearing me out. I'm drunk and pondering things. Don't take advantage of my state to damage stuff. How does circuitry store data? If the circuit doesn't have the advantage of storing bits like conventional technology that's highly refined, what advantage does a qubit have? Isn't it that qubits store and process? In quantum computing, quantum computing has key features. An ordinary computer has bits, registers, logic gates, and algorithms - these all have analogous features in a quantum computer. Instead of bits, a quantum computer has quantum bits (qubits). What's intriguing is that qubits can store zero and one - a qubit can store zero and one and zero, and infinite values between and multiple states can store multiple values. This sounds confusing - like a particle or wave, Schrödinger's cat alive or dead, a car, bicycle, or bus. In gentler terms, numbers and qubits store a physics concept called superposition. Like waves, a third wave contains both originals. If you blow a flute or pipe, it fills with a standing wave. The wave has a fundamental frequency - the basic note you're playing - but it also has lots of overtones and harmonics (higher-frequency multiples of the fundamental). The wave in the pipe contains multiple waves simultaneously. They're together as a combined wave that includes everything. Qubits in superposition represent multiple states and multiple numeric values simultaneously. A quantum computer can store multiple numbers and process them simultaneously, working in serial (a series of things in sequence) parallel (multiple things at the same state and moment). In measuring, the words collapse the states and give an answer to the problem. Estimates suggest quantum computers will have the ability to parallel process millions of times faster than a conventional computer. If correctly built, a quantum computer could be smaller and more energy efficient than a massive parallel computer."
